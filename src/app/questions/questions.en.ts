    question: 'Surely you\'re just puppets of the green parties?',
    summary: 'We are a group of citizens who are concerned about the ecological crisis. We have no ties with Groen, Ecolo or any other political party. Each one of us has his or her ideological preferences; this proposal aims to involve everyone in the debate about the huge challenges that the ecological crisis imposes on us. Both, the political left and right, will rather sooner have to face this reality. A Citizens\' Parliament consists of a group of citizens who are demographically representative for the entire Belgian population. As a result, different ideological tendencies will be present.',

    question: 'How can one be drawn as a citizen?',
    summary: 'A lottery process takes about six weeks. First, a large database of residents of Belgium is identified. A number of people are randomly selected from the database and invited by telephone and letter. The invitation explains the task of the Citizens\' Parliament and provides information about dates, location, accommodation, fees and available support for travel and care responsibilities. The group of people responding to the invitation is then systematically supplemented with new random samples. Demographic criteria such as gender, age, level of education, socio-professional categories, geographical distribution, type of residential area, etc. are all taken into account.',

    question: 'Will you organize the Citizen\'s Parliament yourselves?',
    summary: 'Oh no. To avoid any semblance of partiality, the citizens behind this proposal do not want to play a role in the organization of the whole process, the selection of the experts or the supervision. The Citizens\' Parliament should also be able to operate as independently as possible from any political, economic or social player. Therefore, the Citizens\' Parliament is initiated and financed by the federal government. A coordination group, advisory board, facilitation team, legal support committee, and monitoring panel together ensure its public transparency, political independence and democratic legitimacy.',

    question: 'A Citizen\'s Parliament isn\'t really representative, is it?',
    summary: 'When drawing lots for the members of a Citizens\' Parliament, demographic criteria such as gender, age, level of education, socio-professional categories, geographical distribution, type of residential area, etc. are all taken into account. This actually makes the Citizens\' Parliament a lot more representative than the average parliament. For example, one fifth of the members of the Belgian parliament are lawyers, while less than 1% of Belgians are. Many workers and farmers are not represented. What parliament in the world can claim that it has 29% members with a lower degree of formal education, like the French Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat? The narrow spectrum of knowledge and life experiences in existing parliaments can be detrimental to democracy. Smart drawing of lots creates more representativeness, more widely supported policy proposals and thus more legitimacy.',

    question: 'Is the Citizens\' Parliament inclusive enough?',
    summary: 'Good question. Despite the representative drawing system, there are important participation barriers. The financial threshold is removed with daily allowances, transport allowances and accommodation. Childcare is provided, help with elderly care, care for family members with disabilities, and more. Where necessary (e.g. teachers) replacement is organised. In addition, there are also verbal barriers to be considered: some citizens, thanks to their education, favorable social living conditions or extroverted character, can express themselves more easily than others. A short training in learning to speak in public, and to listen in groups can smooth out the existing differences, together with caring facilitation of each group conversation.',

    question: 'Aren\'t there already a lot of initiatives around citizen participation?',
    summary: 'Many of these initiatives do not make use of representative drawing of lots, resulting in an over-representation of people with a lot of time, which does not promote diversity. As such, these forms of citizen participation are counterproductive. In addition, the ecological crisis calls for a broad, transversal approach at various levels of government with a long-term perspective. Smaller, less visible consultative bodies around specific sub-problems do not have the necessary drive and energy. Finally, the power of many citizen participation bodies is very limited. In our plan, none of the citizens\' proposals is lost; each one is either implemented by the competent government(s) or voted in the competent parliament(s). If a proposal is voted down, a thorough and public motivation follows.',

    question: 'Will the expert panel consist of left-wing academics only?',
    summary: 'No. It is of the utmost importance to inform the members of the Citizens\' Parliament in a pluralistic way. The panel consists of experts, stakeholders and rights-holders (representatives of those whose interests and/or rights are threatened or could just be positively influenced by possible measures). However, it is important to keep in mind the scientific consensus regarding the ecological crisis in the composition of the panel. It is also necessary to have different and sometimes contradictory voices. During the French Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat, the participants listened to climate scientists, ecologists, legal experts, journalists, activists, architects, representatives of industry, construction, agriculture, energy, transport and mobility, ministries, trade unions, civil servants, NGOs, think tanks, and many more.',

    question: 'Politicians are never going to accept this proposal because they are giving up their power with it?',
    summary: 'Good question. Indeed: if politicians only have something to lose with this idea, we should immediately classify it as politically unfeasible. And however good or necessary an idea may be, if it is politically unfeasible it will die a silent death. Fortunately, examples (such as the Irish Civic Parliament on abortion laws) show that this form of civic democracy empowers politicians rather than weakens them. A Citizens\' Parliament can enable party politics to achieve a stronger environmental policy. Moreover, many politicians are dissatisfied with the crippling institutional system of which they are part.',

    question: 'Do you want to abolish the existing parliaments?',
    summary: 'No, we do not. We do not propose to replace one system (with elected citizens) with another (with citizens drawn by lot). Citizen democracy is a strengthening of elected representation. We believe that the majority of Flemish, Walloon, Brussels and Belgian citizens agree with us on this point after the protracted governmental negotiations: Belgian party politics could certainly use this reinforcement.',

    question: 'Why should 101 random citizens decide in my place?',
    summary: 'A crucial point. What is the democratic legitimacy of a Citizens\' Parliament? Although the past government negotiations have seriously damaged the legitimacy of political parties, the majority of the population still sees elections as the only democratic option. Elected politicians also decide instead of others. Nevertheless, there are a number of arguments to counter the perception. (a) Our current parliaments are not very representative for the diversity of the population. E.g., there are many lawyers, and few workers, farmers and people with a migration background. (b) A Citizens\' Parliament derives legitimacy from the system of representative drawing by lots, the guarantees of inclusiveness, the checks and balances built into the organizational structure, the transparency of the process, and more. (c) Finally, the most persuasive argument: the decisions of the Citizens\' Parliament are still to be implemented or voted for by elected politicians.',

Care duties can also prevent people from making time for the activities of the Citizens\' Parliament. Therefore, child care is provided, along with help with care for the elderly, or care for family members with a disability.

    question: 'Surely the \'ordinary\' parliament is also a \'Citizens\' Parliament\'?',
    summary: 'Yes, that\'s right. Politicians are also citizens! Yet there are crucial differences between a parliament with elected citizens and one with drawn members. The second is much more representative of the diversity of the population. Many workers and farmers are not represented in the average parliament. Which parliament in the world can claim to have 29% less educated members, such as the French Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat? Nor are the drawn citizens united by party programmes. They do not have to follow the guidelines of their party cadres. Nor do they have to engage in sharp, mediatized ideological struggles. When they become acquainted with the interests and perspectives of the many other participants, they become more diplomatic and a lot less ideologically fixed. Transcending the political polarization results in more efficient and thus faster decision-making. Contrary to the logic of competition, Citizens\' Parliaments present democracy as cooperation.',
