  "explainerTitle1": "We’re facing unprecedented ecological challenges",
  "explainerText1": "A warming climate, loss of biodiversity and insect mass, gigantic pollution,... Scientists and activists alike have been warning for years for the ecological crisis and its societal impact. It’s the reality the left ánd the right have to face, sooner or later.",
  "explainerTitle2": "Party politics has proven ineffective",
  "explainerText2": "The endlessly long government negotiations make it clear: also our democracy is in crisis. Fighting between parties results in governmental standstill.

  "explainerTitle3": "The solution: A Citizens’ Parliament?",
  "explainerText3": "Man or woman, young or old, many or few degrees: everyone should have their say at the table. With sufficient time and information, a group of randomly selected citizens can arrive at valuable policy proposals, carried by all. Not fearing the next elections, they can face the long term.",
  "explainerTitle4": "Many other countries have led the way",
  "explainerText4": "A citizens’ parliament is no panacea. Yet, it has proven to be valuable. In Ireland randomly selected citizens solved the abortion issue. The French president Macron organized a citizens’ convention around the climate. Randomly selected citizens don’t replace representative politics, but enrich it.",
