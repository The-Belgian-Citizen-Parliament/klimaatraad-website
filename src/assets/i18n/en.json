  "mainSubtitle": "Combine more participation from citizens and an ambitious environmental policy? The Citizens' Parliament has a proposition ready for our federal government! 101 randomly selected citizens, representative of the diversity of the Belgian population, who, with support from scientists and experts, will think about the greatest challenge of our time.",

  "explainerTitle1": "We are facing unprecedented ecological challenges",
  "explainerText1": "Devastating floods, heat records and droughts, loss of biodiversity and insect mass, catastrophic pollution and more. Scientists and activists alike have been warning us for years about the ecological crisis and its societal impact. It is the reality that both, left and right, will have to face rather sooner than later.",
  "explainerTitle2": "Party politics has failed to reverse the trend",
  "explainerText2": "Our politicians should be guiding us through these crises with long-term vision and policy, yet they seem to be running behind the facts. Scientists warn us that the European norms might not even be sufficient, we fail to meet even those. We’re preserving the status-quo while the regions quarrel over who should do how much effort. Yet what we need is cooperation: between citizens, scientists and politicians.",
  "explainerTitle3": "The solution: A Citizens’ Parliament?",
  "explainerText3": "Everyone should have their say at the table, regardless of gender, age or education. With sufficient time and information, a group of randomly selected citizens can make valuable policy proposals. Without fearing the next elections, these citizens can afford to think about the long term perspectives.",
  "explainerTitle4": "Many other countries have led the way",
  "explainerText4": "In Ireland, randomly selected citizens solved the abortion issue. In South-Australia and South Korea, they solved the issue around nucleair energy. The French president Macron organized a citizens’ convention around the climate. The Netherlands launched the same call to their government just now. And did you know that the German region in Belgium has the world's first permanent Citizens' parliament?",
