The Citizens' Parliament has a proposition ready for our brand-new government! 101 randomly selected citizens, representative of the Belgian population, who, with support from scientists and experts, will think about the greatest challenge of our time.",

  "explainerTitle1": "We are facing unprecedented ecological challenges",
  "explainerText1": "A heating climate, loss of biodiversity and insect mass, catastrophic pollution and more. Scientists and activists alike have been warning us for years about the ecological crisis and its societal impact. It is the reality that both, left and right, will have to face rather sooner than later.",
  "explainerTitle2": "Party politics has failed to reverse the trend",
  "explainerText2": "The endless government negotiations make it clear: also our democracy is in crisis. The constant bargaining has resulted in a governance stalemate. Political parties are fighting each other while we should all work together: citizens, scientists and politicians.",
  "explainerTitle3": "The solution: A Citizens’ Parliament?",
  "explainerText3": "Everyone should have their say at the table, regardless of gender, age or education. With sufficient time and information, a group of randomly selected citizens can make valuable policy proposals. Without fearing the next elections, these citizens can afford to think about the long term perspectives.",
  "explainerTitle4": "Many other countries have led the way",
  "explainerText4": "In Ireland, randomly selected citizens solved the abortion issue. In South-Australia and South Korea, they solved the issue around nucleair energy. The French president Macron organized a citizens’ convention around the climate. The Netherlands launched the same call to their government just now. And the German region in Belgium has the world's first permanent Citizens' parliament.",
